Tutorial for installing mongoDB 1.4.4 with PHP Driver on Ubuntu 9.04

Build and Install mongoDB:
Note: Steps 1-3 installs dependencies.
Note: Step 6 builds the source code so it can take some time to finish.

1) apt-get -y install tcsh git-core scons g++
2) apt-get -y install libpcre++-dev libboost-dev libreadline-dev xulrunner-1.9.1-dev
3) apt-get -y install libboost-program-options-dev libboost-thread-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-date-time-dev
4) git clone git://github.com/mongodb/mongo.git
5) git checkout r1.4.4
6) scons all
7) scons --prefix=/opt/mongo install

Before proceeding, make sure you are in the directory where the mongoDB executable is, and the Mongo executable is called mongod. In our case this would be:
/opt/mongo/bin/mongod

To start mongoDB in default mode, where data will be stored in the /data/db directory, and listening on port 27017, just type: ./mongod
mongoDB will be running in the foreground in a terminal window. You can stop mongoDB by using 'CTRL-C'.
Assuming you can start and stop mongoDB, proceed to the next section.

Create /etc/init.d/mongodb script to start/stop mongoDB as a service:

1) The mongoDB script is included with this tutorial and part of this repository. Please add the script to the /etc/init.d directory on your Ubuntu server.
2) You can type: service mongodb stop (to stop mongoDB, it essentially kills the process)
3) You can type: service mongodb start (to start mongoDB)
4) You can type: service mongodb restart (to restart mongoDB, it essentially calls stop and then start)

Build and Install PHP Driver:
Note: Step 1 installs dependencies.

1) sudo apt-get install php-pear
2) sudo pecl install mongo
3) Add the following line to your php.ini file: extension=mongo.so
4) If pecl runs out of memory, make sure memory_limit in php.ini is set to at least 32M.
5) Restart Apache or whatever webserver you are using.
6) Start or restart mongoDB.

Congrats you're done; that wasn't too hard was it?
